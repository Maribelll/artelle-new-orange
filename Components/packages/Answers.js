            It takes 4-6 weeks to complete most websites. If your website needs
            to be completed by a certain date we can work with you to get it
            live in time.

            Once we get started on your website, we will send out a
            questionnaire that will cover most of the needed information. In
            addition, we will request any logo files, brand guidelines, or
            imagery that you might have available.

          <div style={{ maxWidth: "85%", color: "#2E303D" }}>
            If your website needs more or fewer pages, you have your own
            content, or if your website needs a facelift, without any major
            changes to the layout, we can work with you on building a custom
            package just for you.
