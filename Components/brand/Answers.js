            Take a look at our New Business package that includes everything in
            Brand & Logo Design Packages, as well as the Website Design
            Packages.

            Typically 2-4 weeks, depending on the package. E-commerce projects
            that involve product photography can take longer. The base package
            can take as little as 2 weeks. And most fall somewhere in the
            middle.

            At the beginning of the project, we will set you up with a dedicated
            project board that will outline the timeline and outstanding tasks.
            The board allows for commenting and submitting feedback and is a
            great way to stay on the same page about everything that's happening
            with your project.

          </label>
          <div style={{ maxWidth: "85%", color: "#2E303D" }}>
            We design and develop in stages, and at each stage, you will be able
            to send your edits and feedback. The process is reiterative and
            because of it, there's an unlimited amount of edits you can request.

          <input type="radio" name="vkl" id="vkl5" />
          <label style={{ color: "#2E303D" }} htmlFor="vkl5">
            How much will my e-commerce branding project cost?
          </label>
          <div style={{ maxWidth: "85%", color: "#2E303D" }}>
            Because there are many factors in e-commerce that vary one company
            to another, like the amount of products, type of product photos,
            types of email templates and more, we encourage you to reach out to
            us so we can build a custom pricing package based on your needs.

          <div style={{ maxWidth: "85%", color: "#2E303D" }}>
            A project like website design or branding can be a significant time
            investment on both sides. So we ask you to be available for edits,
            revisions, feedback, and any needed Zoom meeting in between. Timely
            collaboration, where both parties are invested, brings the best
            results in our experience.
