          <p>
            We process the data of our clients, supporters, interested parties,
            business partners or other persons if we have a contractual or other
            business relationship with them and, as a result, perform our tasks
            and are recipients of services and benefits.
          </p>

            We also process your data on the basis of our legitimate interests,
            e.g., when administrative tasks or public relations work are
            involved.
          </p>

          <p>
            The data processed in this way, the type, scope and purpose and the
            necessity of its processing, are determined by the business or
            contractual relationship concluded with you, which also determines
            the necessity of any data disclosures (we will of course explicitly
            point this out to you).
          </p>

          <p>
            We delete data that is no longer required to fulfill our statutory
            and business purposes. This is determined according to the
            respective tasks and contractual relationships. The retention period
            of your data is determined according to how it may be relevant for
            business processing, as well as with regard to any warranty or
            liability obligations based on our legitimate interests in
            regulating them. We continuously review the necessity of retaining
            the data. The statutory retention obligations always apply.

            course of providing our contractual services. The deletion of
            information with regard to contractual services and contractual

            is stored by us for the purpose of processing the enquiry and in the
            event of follow-up questions. Under no circumstances will we pass on

            processing your enquiry, provided there are no legal obligations to
            retain data. We assume that processing is complete if it can be
            inferred from the circumstances that the matter in question has been
            conclusively clarified.

            <strong>GDPR Rights</strong>
          </p>

          <p>If you are a European Citizen, you have the following rights:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              to confirmation as to whether data relating to them is being
              processed,&nbsp;
            </li>

            <li>
              to information about the data processed, to further information
              about the data processing and to copies of the data;
            </li>

            <li>
              to correction or completion of incorrect or incomplete data;
            </li>

            <li>to immediate erasure of the data concerning them;</li>

            <li>
              to receive the data concerning them and provided by them and to
              transfer this data to other providers/controllers.
            </li>

            <li>
              to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority if they are of
              the opinion that the data concerning them is being processed by
              the provider in breach of data protection provisions.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In addition, the provider is obliged to inform all recipients to
            whom data has been disclosed by the provider of any correction or
            deletion of data or restriction of processing that takes place.
            However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is
            impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Notwithstanding
            this, the user has a right to information about these recipients.
          </p>

          <p>
            Likewise, users and data subjects have the right to object to the
            future processing of data concerning them, insofar as the data is
            processed by the provider. In particular, an objection to data
            processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.
          </p>

          <p>
            The above rights may be limited in some circumstances, for example,
            if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about
            another person, if you ask us to delete information which we are
            required to have by law, or if we have compelling legitimate
            interests to keep it. We will let you know if that is the case and
            will then only use your information for these purposes. You may also
            be unable to continue using our services if you want us to stop
            processing your personal information.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you wish to exercise your right to object, simply contact us.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Breaches/Notification</h2>

          <p>
            Databases or data sets that include personal information may be
            breached inadvertently or through wrongful intrusion. Upon becoming
            aware of a data breach, we will notify all affected individuals
            whose personal information may have been compromised, and the notice
            will be accompanied by a description of action being taken to
            reconcile any damage as a result of the data breach. Notices will be
            provided as expeditiously as possible after which the breach was
            discovered.
